# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

A few weeks after starting his new role, Jeremy is approached by upper management about a special project. AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition


When comparing our MechaCar to its competitor’s; Many metrics that will be of interest should be tested for the consumer to include price, design, fuel efficiency, horsepower, and safety features. The consumer may also like the carbon waste outputed to be lower. 

A null hypothesis will be that these metrics do not vary from the competition, and the alternative hypothesis will be that the MechaCar do  vary significantly in these variables compared to the competition.
